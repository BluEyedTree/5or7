This project involved training a logistic regression on 200 pixel images of either a 5 or 7. 

Various processing steps were taken in order to improve the predictive power of the logistic model. The first was to center the images, and then scale.

This was not very succesful, yielding a 60% accurate prediction rate in the test data set. I would advise using a more robust model for image identification problems.
